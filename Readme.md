## üìùDescription

Deep Learning **frameworks** have speeded up the model development process by abstracting away the underlying implementations and providing a **high level API**. However it still requires one to have a foundational knowledge in DL and a good **programming experience** to use those APIs for developing models. We **solve this** by providing a user-friendly webapp, where users with little or no programming exeprience can develop models for Standard **Neural Network**, Convolutional Nueral Networks as well as Recurrent Neural Networks. The user **choses the model architecture using a drag and drop functionality**, developing a network/graph of how different layers are interconnected, our server processes this information and **generates equivalent PyTorch** code for the model and puts the model on training.  The user gets back the **model code, inference code and the trained model**.

We have also **integrated a collaboration system** for a group of people to work together on a project, a version control system type mechanism to keep track of how different architecture perform by making and keeping a record of all the commits.


- Users with **no deep learning** or programming **experience** can quickly develop models of their choice to solve their problems
- An **automation tool for developers** to quickly try out different model architectures and chose the best one instead of starting from scratch on each try.
- **Collaboration feature** to allow a group of people to work together on a project and design the best architecture.

## üìàProgress

- [x] Support drag and drop functionality for NN, CNN, RNN
- [x] Develop a collaboration system for multiple users to work on a project.
- [x] Provide model code, infernce code and the trained model
- [ ] provide little information about what each layer does for unfamiliar people



---

## üîÆFuture Scope

- **Advanced/SOTA models** : Allowing complex sequence netowrks such as **rnn-encoder cnn-decoder, transformers**, generative networks such as **GANs, diffusion models** to be developed on our webapp. This will require **refactoring** the current code-gen technique and defining functors to handle each possible block of the network. Also develop a **common endpoint** to allow layers from cnn,rnn and snn so users have more customizability.
- **Inferring user's problem** : Instead of just giving them an interface to develop a model, we could them an **interface to describe the problem they're facing**, and generate recommendation about what type and architecture of model they should proceed with. This can be achieved by training a **miny language model** on existing models data with a **'problem description - model architecture used'** labels.


---

## üí∏Applications

This can be used anywhere Deep Learning models can be of value. The main objective is, its not limited to people with a lot of Deep Learninig experienc or proficiency in programming. It can be used by anyone, as it abstracts the code writing part.

We can **monetize** this providing **trained model to subscribed users**. Training custom models is heavy computational taks and requires alot of infrastructure to be setup. The **code generation** part will be **accessible to anyone**.
